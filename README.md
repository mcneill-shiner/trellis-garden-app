# Trellis Garden Planner App

## Objective

A web app for use in planning a garden, particularly tracking planting dates and other time-sensitive tasks.

### Who is it for?

Any vegetable gardener, whether they're working a small community garden plot or a large homestead. Trellis is geared towards both gardeners growing from seed, as well as those transplanting nursery-bought seedlings.

## MVP Functionality

- Define basic garden settings such as zone and frost dates
- Add plants to planner from available templates
- Maintain a garden task list based on plants that have been added, with dates automatically calculated based on garden and plant settings
- Check off gardening tasks as they're completed

### Future Functionality

- Ability to customize plants from template
- Weather forecast, including frost and heat warnings
- Garden zone lookup by zip
- Guidance on selecting frost dates
- Easily adjust frost date based on forecast (w/ advice)
- GANNT/calendar view of tasks
- Ability to add more than one garden
- Option to distinguish between beginner & experienced gardener, with tooltips displaying or not
- Content & knowledge base
- Store (dropship)
- Major feature: space planning tool, eventually with a time component

## App Status

### Next Steps

- Set up plant db
- Dashboard ui (w/ hardcoded sample data?)

### Questions/Unknowns

- Do users' plants need to work as copies/references to the original db?
- Is a nonrelational db the best option for this? Most flexible
